Salesforce inspector
===========================
Chrome and Firefox extension to add a metadata layout on top of the standard Salesforce UI to improve the productivity and joy of Salesforce configuration, development, and integration work.


Features
-----
* Quickly view field information directly from a record detail page, edit page or Visualforce page.
* Quickly view and edit all data for a record, even data that is not on the page layout.
* Perform quick one-off data exports and imports directly from within Salesforce. Data can be easily copied to and from Excel. No need to log in again when you are already logged in with your browser.
